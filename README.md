# Examination Mark System

This project is a simple Java console application designed to help users calculate and display examination marks and percentages for multiple subjects. 
It demonstrates basic Java concepts such as :

- Input handling
- String parsing
- Arithmetic operations.

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of personal preparation for an academic Java programming competition (Cyberwarrior). It aims to strengthen understanding of object-oriented principles, input handling, and real-world logic building.


## Features

- Accepts multiple subject entries from the user
- Parses input in the format: `SubjectName,MarksObtained/TotalMarks`
- Calculates and displays percentage for each subject
- Displays results in a clean, readable format

## Sample Output

```
Enter number of subjects: 2
Enter subject 1: Mathematics,90/100
Marks: 90/100
Percentage: 90.00%

Enter subject 2: Physics,72/80
Marks: 72/80
Percentage: 90.00%
```

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in your preferred Java IDE or editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2. Compile the `Main.java` file.
3. Run the program from the terminal or editor.
4. Follow the prompts to input subject names and scores.
